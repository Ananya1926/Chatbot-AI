# Chatbot-AI
This code implements a basic chatbot named "Robo" using a mix of rule-based greeting responses and TF-IDF-based similarity for generating responses to user queries on CHATBOTS.
# Key Features of the Code:
Simple Greeting System: 
Handles greetings effectively with predefined inputs and responses.

This is a simple and functional chatbot with an interactive design. It includes contextual responses and modular code (greeting and response functions are well-separated, making the logic easier to maintain and expand).
